# ALX Airbnb Database

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains the design and implementation of a relational database for an **Airbnb-clone platform**.  
The project demonstrates concepts of **requirement analysis, ER modeling, database normalization, SQL schema design, and seeding sample data**.  

It is organized into multiple directories, each focusing on a specific stage of database development.

## ðŸ“– Project Stages

### 1. **Requirement Analysis & ERD**
- Identified entities: **User, Property, Booking, Payment, Review**  
- Defined attributes and relationships.  
- Created an **ER Diagram** (`ERD/airbnb_erd.png`) for visualization.  

### 2. **Normalization**
- Ensured the schema adheres to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.  
- Eliminated redundancies and transitive dependencies.  
- Considered optional optimization with a `Location` table.  

### 3. **Database Schema (DDL)**
- SQL `CREATE TABLE` scripts with:
  - Primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.  
  - Indexes for query optimization.  
  - Check constraints (e.g., review rating 1â€“5).  
  - Cascading deletes for referential integrity.  

### 4. **Seed Data (DML)**
- Inserted realistic sample data:
  - Multiple users, properties, and bookings.  
  - Payments (full and partial).  
  - Reviews linked to bookings.
